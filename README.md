I developed this small program from scratch for one of my term 3 CS courses. It was to be done in a single file, thus many function prototypes at the top. Forgive the mess. As simple of a program as it is, I was proud to have accomplished this to implement the features it has at the time.


**Some notable features of the game:**
* a multiplayer game
* ability add players
* ability to save a game state and resume at a later time
* ability for players to be ranked in a leaderboard (with several sorting options)
* ability to perform a mid-game reset (to restart the game)
